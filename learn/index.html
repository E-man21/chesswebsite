		<h3>Chess is a game for two players, who are conventionally called White and Black. White always makes the first move to begin a game, and thereafter the players move alternately. The game is played on the familiar chessboard. Each player has 16 pieces. The pieces used by Black are colored black or red; those used by White may be white, a shade of white, or the natural color of boxwood. The object of play is to capture one particular enemy piece, the King. When the King is attacked and cannot possibly escape, he is not actually remove from the board; he is said to be checkmate, and the game ends as a win for the opponet.</h3>

			<h3>The chessboard is a square composed of 64 smaller squares, which are colored alternately light and dark. These small squares are often referred to as white and black, though these two colors are not actually used on most of the boards manufactured. The squares are better called light and dark so as to reserve White and Black exclusively for the names of the players. The players sit at opposite sides of the boards, which must be so placed that each player finds a light square in the corner nearest his right hand. In the diagram, Black's side of the board is always placed at the top, white's at the bottom.

			<h3>The "ROOK" moves parallel to the sides of the board any distance along an unobstructed line of squares. Thus a rook may command as many as 14 squares.</h3>
			<h3>The "KNIGHT" has a peculiar move, best described as "to the nearest square of opposite color that is not adjacent." He moves in the shape of an inverted L.</h3>
			<br>
			<h3>The "BISHOP" moves any distance along an unobstructed diagonal line squares.</h3>
			<br>
			<h3>The "QUEEN" combines the powers of the rook and bishop. That is, she can move any distance along an unobstructed line of squares, parallel to the side of the board or diagonally.</h3>
			<br>
			<h3>The "KING" only moves 1 step everywhere but does not move in checks.</h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>The "PAWN" is the only piece that may never move backward. Its noncapturing move is straight ahead. Gets promotion in the end of the board.</h3>
